    <p>Description: Charmander is a small, bipedal Pokémon with a slender, orange body and a long, tapering tail. Its skin is covered in small, rough scales, and it has four small claws on each of its hands and feet. Charmander has a large, flame-shaped tail that burns with a bright orange flame. Charmander is a docile creature, but it can become aggressive if it feels threatened. It is a popular choice among Pokémon trainers due to its powerful fire attacks and its potential to evolve into the powerful Charizard.</p>
